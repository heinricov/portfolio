                hello, you can know me briefly here.
              </h3>
              <p class="my-4">
                My full name is Heinricov Abraham Diego, I am the first son of
                two brothers, I was born in the city of Batam Kep. Riau on June
                29, 1993, I am a private employee at a company in the city of
                Jakarta. My current position is in the accounting support team.
              </p>
              <p class="my-4">
                I became interested in the world of web developers in 2017 when
                I was in college and I saw my friends from the IT department
                studying coding, since then I started studying independently.
              </p>
              <p class="my-4">
                although it is not easy to learn, for me the things that are
                difficult to learn are the most interesting things to learn,
                because by learning things that are difficult for us to
                understand, we can easily understand things that are easier.
              </p>

                I started my study in understanding the world of web programming
                by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JS through the YouTube
                channel and blog, so I tried to make a simple website. continued
                from there, after I learned the basics of making websites with
                simple HTML, CSS, and JS, I started learning Frameworks like
                React and NextJs.
              </p>
              <p class="my-4">
                Until now I continue to develop my skills in my understanding of
                the world of website programming, and I hope that my skills can
                have a positive impact on those around me.
